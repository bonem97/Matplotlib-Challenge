<h1>Plot.ly Exploration - Belly Button Biodiversity</h1>

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

-----PROCESS------
Use D3 library to read through samples.json.
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
