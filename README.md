<h1>Matplotlib and Pymaceuticals</h1>

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens administered over the course of 45 days.

-----PROCESS------
Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
Generate a bar plot that shows  the number of mice per time point for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
Generate a pie plot that shows the gender distribution for mice in the study.
Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
Generate a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.
Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Calculate the correlation coefficient for the data in this figure as well.
